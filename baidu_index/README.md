Introdunction:
--------------------------

baidu_index.py is a crawler for Baidu Indices. One can get daily Baidu searching indices of given list of words during the given period with appropriate usage.

This script uses argparse module for getting inputs. For list of arguments it takes and instructions, see argparse help document -h.

In this crawler, I logged in my own Baidu account. If used heavily or frequently or with anny purposes other than testing, please log in yours and update cookies.json once.

cookies.json is where web cookies are saved and read from. 

baidu_index.bat is the bat file running the script with my desired arguments and spesifically the path on my own computer.

Since this is my first crawler, the core decrypt codes are modified or say basically copied from https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/147642620.
